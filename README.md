AP CS Project
Little program for boarding animals at an animal hospital.
<br />
Ideas for additional details:\n
<br />
-paying day by pay for pet stay
<br />
do something with cost, revenue, and profit
  we could calculate the cost of housing each pet depending on what type of animal it is and how much food it eats(based on size), and
  then find our profit for each animal, profit for a day, which animal is most profitable, etc.
  
print information on one species at a time
  information on all of pets of that species currently boarded
  cost to board pet of that species
  how many spots are available for pets of that species
  also incorporate into GUI(pictures of the animal as button?)
